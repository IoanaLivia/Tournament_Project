# Tournament_Project : Probabilities & Statitics

### Probabilities & Statitics project developed in the second year at University of Bucharest.

This project serves as a practical application of Bayes's theorem, bringing its concepts to life within a real-world context. Centered around the theme of football, we were tasked with devising relevant scenarios. My project focuses on determining the likelihood of a football game being played at home ("acasa") for each team, as well as predicting the most probable winning team based on a comprehensive dataset of previously recorded football matches.
